##FAQ

- What's the type of application are you doing?

In this application, users would create "quests" for other users. Imagine you create quest "colors". Answers for tasks in this quest would be hex color. For example, we create mission in quest "colors" with task "very first color of twitter". To solve this task, we have to go to webarchive. There we see that first activity of real twitter app appeared in September 2006. And there, we see blue page with background color that's very similar to present color. The answer is #9AE4E8. Woah! We solved first mission of the quest. In future, there will be leaderboard, that would count time spent to finding key. That's it for now! There are many ideas to implement, create issuses here on github if you have any ideas!
